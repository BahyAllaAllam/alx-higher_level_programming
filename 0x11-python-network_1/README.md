# 0x11. Python - Network #1

## Learning Objectives

### General
- How to fetch internet resources with the Python package **urllib**
- How to decode urllib body response
- How to use the Python package **requests** *(requests is way simpler than urllib)*
- How to make HTTP GET request
- How to make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. request
- How to fetch JSON resources
- How to manipulate data from an external service

### Coding Guidelines
- Allowed editors: **vi, vim, emacs**
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3** (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A **README.md** file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A **README.md** file at the root of the folder of this project is mandatory
- Your code should use **pycodestyle** (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Use `get` to access dictionary value by key (won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist)
- Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (length will be verified)
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
